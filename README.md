# ExtendoClip
extended clipboard app in tkinter

Main Features:
Automatically copies all items from clipboard to a list, which can be accessed later (like windows key + v)


This list can:
- Be saved to a file
- Used to get old items you may want to quickly get back
- cleared, so a new list may be made
- remove individual items - so that the user can make the list they want and save it
- double click - saves the item to your clipboard

<p></p>

press ctrl + ` to generate a quick view of recent clipboard items:


This window can be navigated by pressing up or down, and selected with enter (meant to be quick way to access recent clipboard items)


Press enter when open to close the window and copy the selected item
 
This is a personal project that I thought might actually be useful instead of physics sims and games. Unforutnately I hate tkinter now but it is a really easy module to use if you need something quickly made (project took me like 3 days off and on)
 
bit spaghettiish. Todo is basically what i need going for it. Could have tonnes of extra features, but tkinter cant even export when i load an icon into it 
(tried on other projects and it just cant work even when i manually add dynamic file path checking).


The main extra features I would want to add are:

- Options - Hotkey settings
- Themes - dark mode (3rd party ones seem to need ttk, which is like styling for tkinter)
- Listbox Scroll bars
